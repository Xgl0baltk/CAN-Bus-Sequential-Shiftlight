# CAN-Bus-Sequential-Shiftlight

The idea for this comes from Jon over at Chippernut.com
The wiring is basically the same and the fuctionality is 
simalar to the V1 (http://www.chippernut.com/blog/welcome)
but the code has been reimagined from the groud up and 
uses the CAN Bus libraries from sparkfun to send OBD PID 
requests over the CAN bus using the MCP2515 chip

Blog post for this too: http://crumpspot.blogspot.com/2015/09/can-bus-sequential-shift-light.html

I also ended up making a custom board for this too.
