# CAN-Bus-Sequential-Shiftlight

The idea for this comes from Jon over at Chippernut.com
The wiring is basically the same and the fuctionality is 
simalar to the V1 (http://www.chippernut.com/blog/welcome)
but the code has been reimagined from 
the groud up and uses the CAN Bus libraries from sparkfun 
to send OBD PID requests over the CAN bus. I'm using the MCP2515
